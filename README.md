# Real-time Mobile Car Pose Estimation with CoreML 

![](car.gif)


Small demo of real-time car pose estimation using a custom trained CoreML model. 

### NOTE: 
This model was only trained to handle a specific car model, it just happens to work on other similar hatchback style cars. 

Requires [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to download OpenCV framework.
